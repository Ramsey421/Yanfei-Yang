  <h1>Soldiers at war with PTSD 
  </h1>
  
  <div>
  According to data from Veterans Affairs obtained (after weeks of repeated requests) by Global News, psychiatric conditions are the second-most common of all causes of disability claims among those who served in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The three most common mental health ailments in the military, according to a senior psychiatrist with the Canadian Forces, are depression, PTSD and substance abuse.<br/><br/>
Psychiatric conditions such as these accounted for a total of 3,424 disability claims related to service in Afghanistan (Some vets made multiple claims, and Veterans Affairs could not tell Global News how many people in total made claims for these conditions).<br/><br/>
For context, around 40,000 Canadian troops served in Afghanistan and 158 died.<br/><br/>More than 80 per cent of the time, soldiers have more than one diagnosis, and the three most common conditions often intersect.<br/><br/>PTSD, a disorder brought on by trauma, can manifest itself in different ways, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, anger or mood disorders, to name a few.<br/><br/>Some soldiers in this series describe an endless struggle with these symptoms while others have emerged from the darkness of PTSD. They all told Global News they were speaking out to encourage others to do so.</div>

The sacrifices and 
achievements of those who gave so much in the
effort to restore peace and freedom are not
forgotten.
